Hi, my name is Max and I'm currently a student at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).

I'm an analytically minded individual who aims to solve complex, data-driven problems through Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
I enjoy discussing approaches to complex problems and aim to bring a multidisciplinary perspective to all challenges I face.

I'd love to get in touch!
